## Overview

**Quantum Burst Communication (QBC)** is a modular, redundant protocol for transmitting information via short-lived entangled clusters.  
Rather than preserving coherence over long distances, QBC embraces decoherence and leverages statistical redundancy to reconstruct messages with high reliability.

This architecture is designed to:
- Use current quantum optical hardware (SPDC sources, photon detectors, tomography)
- Reduce dependence on coherence time
- Be scalable, fault-tolerant, and experimentally testable

## Core Concept

Each symbol (e.g., a letter) is encoded in a **burst** of 1,000 identical entangled clusters.  
Messages are reconstructed by:
- Synchronizing local measurements
- Using statistical thresholds (e.g., 90% agreement)
- Logging each symbol once confidence is reached

This allows short coherence events to function collectively, forming robust communication packets.
